          These are my pets Daniel and Captian. Captain is a 180 lb Great Dane. As you can probably guess, yes he is much bigger than pictured. This is just one of my favorite pictures of him so I had to use it. Daniel is my kitty. Don't ask me how a female cat ended up with the name Daniel becuase I can't tell you.
