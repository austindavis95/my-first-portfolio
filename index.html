          This is BringtheTech. BringtheTech is a fully interactive full stack website. BringtheTechs primary function allows users to purchase used and refurbished electronics. Throughout the developement of this project my team and I used a variety of tools we had never used before. Like Handlebars.js, mySQL, node.js, and express.js. The most challenging obsitical that was constantly an issue was Github. We had countless issue with pushing and pulling from git and git merging.This costs us hours of time each week and is the reason for having minimal commits. After learning how to use Handlebars and dealing with the headaches of git we were able to play with more familiar tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Although we didnt have enough to to sytle it exactly the way we wanted by the deadline, we plan to continue adding and contributing to this site!

          These are my pets Daniel and Captian. Captain is a 180 lb Great Dane. As you can probably guess, yes he is much bigger than pictured. This is just one of my favorite pictures of him so I had to use it. Daniel is my kitty. Don't ask me how a female cat ended up with the name Daniel becuase I can't tell you.
